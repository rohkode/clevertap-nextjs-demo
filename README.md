### 🌐 Step 2: (Optional) Setup GitHub Pages to host the project

GitHub Pages only works with **static** apps (like ones built with `next export`).

If you want to deploy this Next.js app publicly, it’s better to use **Vercel** (they own Next.js). It's free, super easy, and takes seconds.

#### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended):
1. Go to: [https://vercel.com/import](https://vercel.com/import)
2. Click **“Import Git Repository”**
3. Sign in with GitHub if needed
4. Select your `clevertap-nextjs-demo` repo
5. Click **“Deploy”**

You’ll get a public URL like: `https://clevertap-nextjs-demo.vercel.app`

Want me to help with deploying to Vercel and setting up a custom domain or `.env` configs too?
